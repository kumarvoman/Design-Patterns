# Design-Patterns
How to code each design pattern in C++ language.

1. The first one is obviously - Singleton

Why ??
Coz this will be asked in almost each and every interview you get, doesn't matter if the company is product based or service based.
bigger mnc or a just few ppl startup.
coz at the end of the day-how good you can code is all that matters.
and you don't wanna miss your chance .. right ??

Also, along with the given design pattern i'll add some of the questions that you might get as a counter of writing correct code.
So don't worry and stay tuned :)

2. Observer Design Pattern
